# RouteCanvas

RouteCanvas is an Android application that allows users to track and visualize their routes on a canvas.

## About

The motivation behind this app is to provide the same functionality, hopefully with the same design, as shown in [this X.com post](https://x.com/samdape/status/1808174105482436709) by [@samdape](https://x.com/samdape).

I created this app because I liked the design. The app allows users to draw their routes on a canvas, which can be useful for tracking walks, runs, or other journeys.

## Features

- Route tracking: Users can start and stop tracking their route
- Visual representation: Routes are displayed as lines on a canvas
- Date and time tracking: Each route is associated with a date and duration
- Save functionality: Users can save their routes
